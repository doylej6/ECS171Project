# ECS171Project

## **Summary**
Using a dataset of 4.2 million U.S car accidents, we wish to explore the connections between time of crash, road conditions, and road features, and the severity of car accidents (in relation to how long it takes to clear the traffic accident). This data set is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents?select=US_Accidents_Dec20.csv), and has 48 different variables. It is important to note this data is only for 49 states, so it might not be able to be applied on data outside of the United States.
